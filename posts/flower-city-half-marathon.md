This was my first time training for a specific time goal. I sat down at my kids' New Year's Eve ski race and decided that I wanted to run a spring Half Marathon. I determined that a goal of 1:50 was reasonable based on my prior performance and selected a [plan from Competitor Magazine](http://cdn.running.competitor.com/files/2013/03/30_nat.pdf "Half Marathon Training Plan"). I modified the plan to include my Les Mills BodyPump classes, Spinning, Pilates and some yoga. This was what my [Half Marathon Training](/static/pdf/Half-Marathon-Training.pdf) plan looked like once I customized it specifically for me. I found the plan challenging but good. There were days where looking at the workout gave my stomach butterflies, but I managed to stick with my goal running for almost every workout.

## Race Day

As with many things I sign up for, I didn't really look carefully with the details of the [Flower City Challenge Half Marathon](http://www.flowercitychallenge.com/) before I signed up. The 7:30 a.m. start. The packet pick-up starting at 6 a.m. and the fact that I didn't secure a hotel room meant a 4 a.m. wake up on race day. With about an hour of sleep the night before, I hopped into the car with friends Teresa and Melissa at 4:45 a.m. and headed up to the race. Luckily Teresa stayed awake and kept me company and I had given up coffee the week of the race so that I'd feel the caffeine from the coffee that morning.

This race was staged out of the [Rochester War Memorial](http://www.bluecrossarena.com/ "War Memorial"). We arrived with plenty of time to spare and promptly found parking a block away. The location was perfect! It was large, there were plenty of bathrooms with short lines and since it was a very chilly morning it was great to wait indoors. We got ourselves all settled and pretty soon it was race time! I found myself strangely nervous. I normally have pre-race nerves, but today was different. I was trying for a particular time, and I knew exactly what pace I needed to achieve it.

I ran the first two miles right next to Teresa at about an 8 minute mile pace. I let her go shortly after mile 2, thinking I would slow things down a bit and eventually ramp back up my pace _(goal pace was 8:19)_.  I don't know if this was a wise move or not. I like to think that by slowing down I was better prepared for the upcoming hills _(that I didn't yet know about)_ but I wonder if I had kept up the speed for a bit longer if I would have come in right at my goal of 1:50 instead of 1:50:47. I will never know, but I do know that I'm ready to work really hard to do even better at the [Wineglass Half](http://www.wineglassmarathon.com/ "Wineglass Half Marathon") this fall!

The things I remember from this race the most include:

- **Clothing and Food:** Losing my [Sports Beans](http://www.sportbeans.com/ "Sports Beans") at mile 10. My hands were freezing and I couldn't get the package to open. They flew out of my hands onto the path. I shed my gloves at mile 4, giving them to a spectator. I've never done that before and it felt strangely terrible. Somehow losing my cheap black gloves made me sad.
- **Highland Park and Cemetery:** I know this area and I mistakenly thought we were going to run by it not all the way through it. I didn't look at the [map](http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/fullscreen/332612207/ "Course Map") much before the race. As much as I disliked the constant hills through the [Mt. Hope Cemetery](http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589936771 "Mt Hope Cemetery") I found this part of the course to be the most inspiring. I gave thanks for my ability to run, and reminded myself to live each day that I have to the fullest. I felt the strongest on this part of the course with an overwhelming feeling of gratitude for this life that I have.
- **Race Song**: Every race I have done has a race song, but I don't usually know the song until I run. Sometimes I run with music and the song reveals itself to me during the run, and sometimes it is just the music I listen to in the days before the run or the morning of the event. Today, I had a new playlist with several songs that my friends suggested using. I only really enjoy listening to music I haven't heard much _(or at all)_ before. Today I chose the race song from the part of the course where I felt most grateful and inspired. That song was, Sweat (Snoop Dogg vs. David Guetta) \[Remix\]. Interestingly enough, my Philly Marathon Song Little Bad Girl (David Guetta) was the song playing as I approached the very first hill. Listening to it always transports me back to Philly and I uttered an audible Thank YOU when the song inspired me to push hard up the first of what would be many hills.
