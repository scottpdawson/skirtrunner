**Weekly Stats:** 48.27 running miles, 1,600+ yards of swimming, 16 miles on bike, 1 lifting session, 2 sessions of yoga and 6 lovely hiking miles.Â I'm ready to taper now! I had hoped to break a 50-mile week for my longest week, but will settle for 48!

This week I struggled with a sore achilles, and then somehow I altered my stride to compensate. This made my longest training run (26.2) really challenging. Jenny was so supportive sticking with me as I really struggled on this run!

The high points of the week include a first open water swim [(read about the swim)](/training/first-open-water-swim/ "First Open Water Swim"), and the 26.2 run [(read about the run)](/training/watermelon-salt-vinegars-and-gatorade-oh-my/ "Watermelon, Salt & Vinegars and Gatorade, Oh My!").
