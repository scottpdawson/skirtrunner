As a relatively novice runner wanting to improve, I've started to read articles and books about pacing. Based on my current race times and my goal race times, the reading I've done lead me to these training paces.

## Just a Run

- **Easy run** 8:54-9:52
- **Long run** 8:56-10:15
- **Recovery** jog 9:59-10:44

_\*my aerobic pace aka aproximate marathon pace is 8:35-9:00_

## Tempo Work

- This is the training speed for a short tempo run called a Lactate Threshold Run. Begin with a 2 mile warm-up run followed by 8-15 minutes at a 7:51-8:10 pace. Recover for 2-5 minutes and repeat the 8-15 minute routine. Complete with a 15 minutes cool down run. The total distance should be 6-7 miles. The effort level is medium/hard
- This is a steady state tempo run. Begin with a 2 mile warm-up run followed by a 10-40 minute run at an 8:01-8:17 pace. Complete the workout with a 15 minute cool down run. The entire run should be between 6 and 11 miles. The effort level is medium.
- This is a steady state run. The goal for this run is to improve stamina. Begin with a 2 mile warm-up run followed by 25-90 minutes at an 8:21-8:42 pace. Complete the run with a 15 minute cool down run. The effort level is medium.

## Speed Work

While I still get a stomach ache when I think about heading out for speed work, I am slowly starting to enjoy this workout. Each of my speed workouts begin with a 2 mile warm up run. I typically incorporate 2-3 miles of speed work, followed by a 1 mile cool down run. On days that I feel strong and motivated I drop to a slow jog between intervals and on those days that I had to push myself out the door or am feeling tired, I walk between.

- **400** 1:42-1:48
- **600** 2:37-2:45
- **800** 3:33-3:44
- **1000** 4:35-4:47
- **1200** 5:30-5:50
- **1600** 7:39-7:52
