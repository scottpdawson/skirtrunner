Pancakes are a favorite in my family! We've tried many recipes, but we always go back to a base recipe from a book my husband got from his parents when he was a bachelor, [Where's Mom Now that I Need Her?](https://www.amazon.com/Wheres-Mom-Now-That-Need/dp/0961539011) However, we've changed the recipe so much that we need to share our version. We realized this when the kids started making the Whole Wheat pancake recipe straight from the book and they weren't the same as what I was making. I was making all the substitutions in my head.

The actual recipe is for 2 people and it calls for whole wheat flour, an egg, milk, oil, sugar, baking powder and salt. We've doubled the recipe and changed most of the ingredients. Our goal? Add as much nutrition as possible and stay full as long as possible.

## Flax & Hemp Pancakes

Yield: 12

These are a perfect Saturday morning breakfast but they are also fast enough to enjoy on a school day! We enjoy 3 pancakes each topped with homemade fruit sauce. The blend of flax and hemp and flours keeps us full until lunch.

### Ingredients

- 2/3 cup whole wheat flour
- 2/3 cup mix of ground flax seed, hemp seed and coconut flour
- 1 1/3 cup almond milk
- 2 Tablespoons coconut oil, melted
- 1 Tablespoon baking powder
- 2 Tablespoons honey
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Directions

- Heat an UNGREASED griddle on the stove while you are preparing the pancakes.
- Combine the flour and mix of flax seed, hemp seed and coconut flour. Add the baking powder and salt. 
- Combine all the wet ingredients. Make sure the milk and eggs aren't too chilled or the coconut oil will solidify. 
- Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until they are blended.
- Use a 1/4 cup measure and pour 4 pancakes onto the griddle. Wait until bubbly and flip. Repeat for all the pancakes. 

### Additional Notes

You can use any oil you like if you don't want to worry about temperature of ingredients. The coconut oil does impart some flavor, so if you would prefer not to have that flavor, use a coconut/canola blend or just canola oil.
