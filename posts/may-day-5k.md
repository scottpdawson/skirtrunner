## Race Day

The [May Day 5K](http://www.mayday5k.org/ "May Day 5K") is a big fundraising event that I help organize every year. This year we had the race professionally timed by [Auyer Timing,](http://www.auyertiming.com/ "Auyer Timing") so Christina and I both took the opportunity to run the race. It was my PR for a 5K - yay! My goal was sub 24 and I hit it. I took a full mile and a bit to catch Xander and his friend Drew and when I caught them Xander promptly hopped in front of me to block me!! He only finished 1 minute behind me again - we're both getting more determined I think.
