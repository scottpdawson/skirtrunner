## Race Day

This was my first time running the [Skunk Cabbage Classic](http://fingerlakesrunners.org/wordpress/road-races/skunk-cabbage-classic/ "Skunk Cabbage Classic")! Originally I was upset that I didn't sign up for the half, but this was a really great distance. It was my first 10K and I enjoyed the challenge of keeping up a quick pace for 6.2 miles.  It was fun to have a big Daily Mile crew there. Christina took a picture of everyone before the race.
